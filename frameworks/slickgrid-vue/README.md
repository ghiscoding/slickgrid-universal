### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript data grid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), which was originally developed by @mleibman, is now available to the Vue world. SlickGrid beats most other data grids in terms of features, customizability & performance (running smoothly with even a million rows). Slickgrid-Vue is a wrapper on top of [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/) (which is a dependency).

Also note that all of these themes also have **Dark Theme** equivalent and even though Bootstrap if often used as the default, it also works well with any other UI framework like Bulma, Material, ...

### Live Demo page

It also works well with any other frameworks like Material or Bulma and there are also couple of extra styling themes based on Material & Salesforce which are also available. You can also use different SVG icons, you may want to look at the [Docs - SVG Icons](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-vue/styling/svg-icons)
