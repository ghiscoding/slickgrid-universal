```

#### Requirements 
- Vue >=3.4
  
### Stackblitz

You can also play with the live Stackbliz [Slickgrid-Vite-Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-vue-demos). It is also the recommended way to provide a repro when opening a new bug/feature request.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/ghiscoding/slickgrid-vue-demos)

Visit the **[Docs - Quick Start](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-vue/getting-started/quick-start)** and/or clone the [Slickgrid-Vue-Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-vue-demos) repository for a local demo. Please make sure to read the documentation before opening any new issue and also consider asking installation and/or general questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=slickgrid) unless you think there's a bug with the library.

### Styling Themes

Multiple styling themes are available
- Default (UI agnostic)
- Bootstrap (see all Slickgrid-Vue [live demos](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-vue-demos/))
- Material (see [Slickgrid-Universal](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal/#/example07))
- Salesforce (see [Slickgrid-Universal](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal/#/example16))

Also note that all of these themes also have a **Dark Theme** equivalent and even though Bootstrap is often used for live demos, it does work well with any other UI framework like Bulma, Material, Quasar...

### Live Demo page
`Slickgrid-Vue` works with all Bootstrap versions, you can see a demo of each one below. It also works well with any other frameworks like Material, Bulma, Quasar... and there are also extra styling themes based on Material & Salesforce which are also available. You can also use different SVG icons, you may want to look at the [Docs - SVG Icons](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-vue/styling/svg-icons)
- [Bootstrap 5 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-vue-demos) / [examples repo](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-vue-demos)

#### Working Demos
For a complete set of working demos (40+ examples), we strongly suggest you to clone the [Slickgrid-Vue Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-vue-demos) repository (instructions are provided in it). The repo comes with multiple examples and are updated frequently (basically every time a new version is out) and it is also used as the GitHub live demo page.
