### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript data grid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), which was originally developed by @mleibman, is now available to the Vue world. SlickGrid beats most other data grids in terms of features, customizability & performance (running smoothly with even a million rows). Slickgrid-Vue is a wrapper on top of [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/) (which is a dependency).
