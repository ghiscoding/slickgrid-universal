## Vanilla Bundle Webpack Demo

Standalone package to simply demo the Vanilla Bundle implementation (no framework associated), we also use it to build the [GitHub Demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal) page from which we run the Cypress E2E tests.

This is basically a simple UI implementation written in plain TypeScript with Webpack bundler to demo most features. We also use this demo to run all our Cypress E2E tests.

### Installation
To get started with this demo, you will need to install the entire project and do the following 2 things:
1. Go to the root of the repo and follow the instructions provided in the main [README](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal#installation), make sure you do the `bundle`
2. Run the pnpm script `dev`
