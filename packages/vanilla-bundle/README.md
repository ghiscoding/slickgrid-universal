## Vanilla Bundle
#### @slickgrid-universal/vanilla-bundle

Vanilla Bundle implementation (no framework, plain TypeSript implementation). This package does what other framework would do, that is to make all the features usable in 1 bundle so that it could then be used by other Apps/Projects, for example we use this bundle in our SalesForce (with Lighning Web Component) App and it requires plain ES6 JavaScript which this bundle also produce (for that there's a `dist-grid-bundle-zip` folder which will zip the ES6 `dist` folder which we then import in SalesForce).

### Installation
This Vanilla Bundle is used in our SalesForce implementation (since it requires plain ES6) and is also used by the standalone `webpack-demo-vanilla-bundle` which serves for demo purposes.

Go to the root of the repo and follow the instructions provided in the main [README](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal#installation)
