## Vanilla Bundle Examples (demo)

Standalone package to simply demo the Vanilla Bundle implementation (no framework associated) and build the [GitHub Demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/slickgrid-universal) page.

This is basically a simple UI implementation written in plain TypeScript to demo most features, we will also use it to run certain Cypress E2E tests.

### Installation
To get started with this demo, you need to run it from the root of monorepo structure.
Go to the root of the repo and follow the instructions provided in the main [README](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal#installation)
