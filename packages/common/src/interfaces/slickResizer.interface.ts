/**
 * A Resizer plugin that can be used to auto-resize a grid and/or resize with fixed dimensions.
 * When fixed height is defined, it will auto-resize only the width and vice versa with the width defined.
 * You can also choose to use the flag `enableAutoSizeColumns` if you want to the plugin to
 * automatically call the grid `autosizeColumns()` method after each resize.
 *
 * There is now also a second grid option `enableAutoResizeColumnsByCellContent` (instead of `autosizeColumns`) that you could use,
 * it's however optional and not enabled by default since there are performance impact to using this option (it needs to loop through your dataset to evaluate sizes).
