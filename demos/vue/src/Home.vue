    <a href="https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid" target="_blank">SlickGrid</a> which was originally developed by &#64;mleibman
    is now available to Vue. I have tried, and used, a few data grids and SlickGrid beats most of them in terms of functionalities
    and performance (it can even handle a million rows).
