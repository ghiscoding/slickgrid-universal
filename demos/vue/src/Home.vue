  <h4>Quick intro</h4>
  <p>
    One of the best javascript datagrid
    <a href="https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid" target="_blank">SlickGrid</a> which was originally developed by &#64;mleibman is now
    available to Vue. I have tried, and used, a few datagrids and SlickGrid beats most of them in terms of functionalities and
    performance (it can easily even handle a million row).
